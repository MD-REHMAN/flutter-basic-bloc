`Futures`
- In many ways Futures in Dart are analogous to Promises in JS. And just like Promises, it have `then` method to get the value.
- It is used to return data Asynchronously.
- Futures can have 3 states:
  - Uncompleted
  - Completed by a value - handled by `then` method
  - Completed by an error - handled by `catchError` method
- Futures also have `whenComplete` method which analogous to finally in a try catch statement.


`FutureBuilder widget`
- It takes Future and Builder method. and Builder the widget when the Future Completes.
- The Builder method provides Snapshot, which can have 3 states: Uncompleted, Completed by a value and Completed by a error
- And it can show diffrent widgets as per the state.

`Streams`
- Just like Future, Streams also return Asynchronously. but not just a single value instead stream of value.
- It also have `StreamBuilder widget` to automatically update the view Stream get new value.
